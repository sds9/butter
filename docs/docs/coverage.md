- **LCOV Report**: For CI/CD integration (`coverage/lcov.info`)
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable format (`coverage/coverage-final.json`)
- **Text Summary**: Console output during test runs

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

Coverage reports are automatically generated during:

- Pull request builds
- Main branch pushes
- Release processes
- Documentation builds

## 📋 Coverage Configuration

Coverage is configured in `vitest.config.ts` with:

- **Provider**: v8 (fast, accurate)
- **Reporters**: HTML, LCOV, JSON, Text
- **Excludes**: Tests, configs, documentation

2. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
3. **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
4. **Use parameterized tests** for multiple scenarios
5. **Test both success and failure paths**
