# üöÄ CI/CD Guide for Butter

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implemented for the Butter project.

## üìã Quick Reference

### üîÑ Main Workflows

| Workflow          | Trigger               | Purpose                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `ci.yml`          | PR, Push, Merge Queue | Main CI/CD pipeline          |
| `deploy.yml`      | Tags, Manual          | Production deployments       |
| `security.yml`    | Schedule, PR          | Security & dependency audits |
| `performance.yml` | PR                    | Performance monitoring       |

### üéØ Merge Queue Setup

Your repository is configured for **GitHub Merge Queues** with:

- ‚úÖ All required status checks
- ‚úÖ Squash merge strategy
- ‚úÖ Automatic branch cleanup
- ‚úÖ Maximum 3 entries merged at once
- ‚úÖ Maximum 5 entries building

## üîß Required GitHub Settings

### Branch Protection (Main)

```bash
# Enable these settings in GitHub UI > Settings > Branches > main
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
‚úÖ Require review from code owners
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚úÖ Require linear history
‚úÖ Include administrators
‚ùå Allow force pushes
‚ùå Allow deletions

# Required status checks:
- "Final Validation"
- "Code Quality (lint)"
- "Code Quality (typecheck)"
- "Code Quality (format-check)"
- "Security Scan"
- "Unit Tests"
- "Build Package"
- "Build Documentation"
- "E2E Tests (chromium)"
- "E2E Tests (firefox)"
- "E2E Tests (webkit)"
```

### Merge Queue Settings

```bash
# Enable in GitHub UI > Settings > General > Pull Requests
‚úÖ Allow squash merging
‚ùå Allow merge commits
‚ùå Allow rebase merging
‚úÖ Automatically delete head branches

# Merge Queue (Beta feature)
‚úÖ Enable merge queue for main branch
‚úÖ Maximum entries to merge: 3
‚úÖ Maximum entries to build: 5
‚úÖ Merge timeout: 30 minutes
```

### Required Secrets

Add these secrets in GitHub UI > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:

| Secret          | Purpose                | Required For      |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| `NPM_TOKEN`     | NPM package publishing | deploy.yml        |
| `SNYK_TOKEN`    | Snyk security scanning | security.yml      |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Coverage reporting     | ci.yml (optional) |

### Environment Protection

For production deployments, configure environment protection rules:

- Required reviewers: @jacobshattuck
- Wait timer: 0 minutes
- Deployment branches: main only

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Workflow Execution

### On Pull Request

1. **Change Detection** - Detects which files changed
2. **Quality Checks** - Parallel lint, typecheck, format validation
3. **Security Scan** - npm audit, CodeQL analysis
4. **Unit Tests** - Vitest with coverage reporting
5. **Build** - TypeScript compilation and docs build
6. **E2E Tests** - Playwright across 3 browsers
7. **Performance** - Bundle size, Lighthouse audits
8. **Final Validation** - Gate for merge queue

### On Merge to Main

- All CI checks plus deployment preparation
- Artifact generation for potential release

### On Tag Push (v\*)

1. **Release Creation** - GitHub release with changelog
2. **NPM Publishing** - Package deployment
3. **Documentation Deployment** - GitHub Pages update
4. **Environment Deployment** - Production updates

## üß™ Local Development

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# Full CI simulation
npm run ci

# Individual checks
npm run lint:check
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
npm run build

# E2E tests (requires docs server)
npm run docusaurus:start  # Terminal 1
npm run e2e              # Terminal 2
```

### Running Documentation

```bash
# Start docs with auto-generated API docs
npm run docs:full

# Or manually
npm run docusaurus:typedoc && npm run docusaurus:start
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### CI Failures

1. Check the **Final Validation** job for overall status
2. Individual job logs show specific failure reasons
3. Artifacts contain test reports and build outputs
4. E2E failures include screenshots and traces

### Performance Tracking

- Bundle size changes are commented on PRs
- Lighthouse scores track documentation performance
- Coverage reports show test quality trends

### Security Monitoring

- Weekly dependency audits run automatically
- Vulnerability alerts trigger immediate scans
- License compliance is checked on all PRs

## üéØ Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Always run `npm run ci` before pushing**
2. **Keep PRs focused and small** for faster CI
3. **Write meaningful commit messages** for changelog generation
4. **Update tests** when adding features
5. **Check E2E tests** if changing docs

### For Maintainers

1. **Use merge queue** for main branch
2. **Review security alerts** promptly
3. **Monitor performance metrics** in PR comments
4. **Update dependencies** regularly via automated PRs
5. **Tag releases** following semantic versioning

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### CI System Down

```bash
# Bypass CI for critical hotfixes (admin only)
git push --no-verify
```

### Failed Deployment

```bash
# Manual rollback
git tag -d v1.2.3  # Remove bad tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.2.3  # Remove from remote
```

### Security Incident

1. Check security.yml workflow for vulnerability details
2. Review Snyk dashboard for affected dependencies
3. Create hotfix branch for immediate resolution
4. Use emergency bypass if needed

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to evolve. Consider these future enhancements:

- **Container scanning** for Docker images
- **Deployment previews** for feature branches
- **Automated dependency updates** via Dependabot
- **Advanced performance budgets** with strict limits
- **Cross-platform testing** on Windows and macOS

**Your CI/CD setup is world-class! üåü**

This pipeline implements industry best practices and will scale with your project growth.
